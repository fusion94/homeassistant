# Overview

My personal [Home Assistant Container](https://home-assistant.io)
configurations.

I utilize Home Assistant to bridge and automate all my home automation products.
It was quickly realized as I expanded beyond some smart bulbs and a Hue hub,
that nothing integrated into a single system for control, automation, and
communication. Home Assistant originally was run on a Raspberry Pi but I have
since moved it to run as a docker container running on a [Synology NAS
DiskStation DS1621+](https://www.synology.com/en-us/products/DS1621+)
